As part of my ongoing development efforts, I plan to enhance my portfolio by implementing semantic HTML markup enriched with RDFa annotations to ensure full accessibility, machine-readability, and cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, I aim to optimize the codebase to improve execution speed and overall performance.

Another key objective is to migrate the data storage architecture to a more robust cloud infrastructure. This includes hosting data files on dedicated servers and integrating custom monitoring tools such as Datadog, Azure Monitor, and Prometheus to ensure reliability, observability, and scalability. These tools will help track performance metrics, detect anomalies, and maintain system health in real time.

For now, I’ve chosen Netlify as a deployment platform to focus primarily on development, but I intend to evolve the architecture to better support long-term growth and technical resilience.
