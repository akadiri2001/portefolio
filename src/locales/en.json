    "aboutText": "\"Creativity is intelligence having fun.\" â€” Albert Einstein\n\nI have always cultivated an analytical mind, guided by the need to understand things deeply rather than being satisfied with their appearance. This attitude naturally led me toward logical and mathematical reasoning, where rigor and clarity are essential.\n\nVery early on, I was drawn to computer science, a field where the recursive nature of my thinking resonated naturally. Each problem becomes a structure to explore, each solution a methodical construction. After completing a science baccalaureate, I chose to pursue two years of preparatory classes, convinced that a solid intellectual foundation is essential for building robust solutions.\n\nMy training in computer science has given me a comprehensive view of the profession: from theoretical foundations to concrete applications, including algorithms, systems, software development, and project management. It also taught me how to combine technical precision and creativity, how to collaborate effectively, and how to remain curious in the face of constant digital developments.\n\nToday, I define myself as a passionate software engineer, capable of transforming ideas into concrete solutions. I enjoy taking on challenges, structuring thoughts, and bringing logic and intuition together to create useful, elegant, and sustainable tools."
