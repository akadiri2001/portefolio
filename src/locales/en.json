  "aboutText": "\"Creativity is intelligence having fun.\" — Albert Einstein\n\nI have always cultivated an analytical mindset, guided by the need to understand things deeply rather than settling for their appearance. This approach naturally led me toward logical and mathematical reasoning, where rigor and clarity are essential.\n\nFrom an early age, I was drawn to computer science, a field where the recursive nature of my thinking found a natural echo. Every problem becomes a subject to explore, every solution a methodical construction. After completing my scientific baccalaureate, I chose to pursue two years of preparatory classes, convinced that a solid intellectual foundation is essential for building robust solutions.\n\nMy computer science education allowed me to acquire a comprehensive view of the profession: from theoretical foundations to practical applications, including algorithms, systems, software development, and project management. It also taught me to combine technical precision with creativity, to collaborate effectively, and to remain curious in the face of the constant evolution of digital technology.\n\nToday, I define myself as a passionate IT engineer capable of transforming ideas into concrete solutions. I enjoy taking on challenges, structuring thoughts, and bringing together logic and intuition to create useful, elegant, and sustainable tools.",
